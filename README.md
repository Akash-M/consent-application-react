## Prerequisites

### Package Manager
This repo is based on Yarn3. Ensure that you have a global installation of
[Yarn3](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#global-install).

You can test if yarn is installed correctly by using:
```sh
yarn --version
```

Upgrade dependencies: 
```sh
npx yarn-upgrade-all
```

Start the frontend
